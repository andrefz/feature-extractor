`feature-extractor` is a LLVM analysis pass to extract static program
features for use in machine learning projects. The extracted features
are those present in the following article:

[Practical Aggregation of Semantical Program Properties for Machine Learning Based Optimization][inria-00551512]

## Requirements

### Platform Requirements

This pass has only been tested on Linux, although it is expected to run on
MacOS without any modifications; Other platforms may require modifications
to the source code (contributions are welcome).

### Build Requirements

In order to build `feature-extractor` from source you will need:

* LLVM 9 or higher
* CMake 3.4.3 or higher
* CMake compatible build system like Make or Ninja
* Modern C++14 compiler (Clang is recommended)

### Runtime Requirements

In order to run this pass, you will need a compiler that either emits LLVM IR
to be used with `llvm-opt` or can use LLVM out-of-tree passes natively, such
as Clang or Rust.

## Building from Source

Example using Clang as compiler and Ninja as build system:

```sh
export CC=clang
export CXX=clang++
export CMAKE_GENERATOR=Ninja
export CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
git clone https://github.com/andrefz/feature-extractor.git
cd feature-extractor
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && cmake --build .
```
